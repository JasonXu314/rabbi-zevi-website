		description: `This book is a translation of “Torasoih Shel Moshiach” - a categorized by subject collection of everything the Rebbe publicly said and printed (Mugeh) regarding Moshiach, from the famous heartfelt plea “Do all you can to bring Moshiach!” 28th of Nissan 5751 (1991) to the fateful day of 27th of Adar 5752 (1992 when physically the Rebbe stopped communicating verbally.)
		This book was originally organized by Rabbi Maimon and approved by the Rebbe.
		"Moshiach is not what people think," as the Alter Rebbe said, “The Moshiach that is coming, is not what people think - and what people think is Moshiach, is not.”`

		description: `Apart from the occasional story and “vort” - “wise saying/teaching” - though steeped in the wellsprings of Chassidus… I really was oblivious.
		Of-course, the Great and Holy Maagid founded - for all intents and purposes - the Chassidic movement, in that it was from his 60 Holy Disciples, Reb Nachum Chernobler, Zusha Of Anipoli… to the Alter Rebbe, that the Chassidic movement became what it is.
		I was delighted to have discovered extraordinarily beautiful & profoundly deep Teachings - remember His disciples were the “Chevriah Kadisha - Holy Group” - Wisdom, That Can Transform Our Lives!`

		description: `What is unique about this translation is that it is not a translation. The Tanya - the most important modern Jewish mystical / philosophical work has long been considered a very difficult read. My grandfather and father helped readers through “Lessons In Tanya,” however for the modern man who has very little time or patience I felt a new English Tanya was necessary. This is a paraphrased translation. In other words I took the ideas in the sequence they are presented in - in the Tanya - and I rewrote them into an idiom that modern man finds more compelling.`

		description: `It is well known that the Baal Shem Tov is the greatest Jewish Mystic, Master, Inspirer… who founded the Chassidic movement, that transformed the flavor, The Soul Of Judaism, forever.
		This book is a paraphrased translation of the book called “Baal Shem Tov on the Torah” written by Rabbi Shimon Menachem Mendel from the city of Gavarshov.
		What makes this collection special - for as he writes in his introduction - he collected from the many authentic sources, beginning with the primary redactors of the Torah of the Baal Shem Tov, Rabbi Yaacov Yosef Pulnah (Toildois Yaakov Yosef) and the Degel Machaneh Efraim among others (the Baal Shem Tov's Illustrious grandson) - is its exactness in finding the authentic teachings of the Baal Shem Tov.`
