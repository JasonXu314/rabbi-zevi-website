		description: `This book is a translation of “Torasoih Shel Moshiach” - a categorized by subject collection of everything the Rebbe publicly said and printed (Mugeh) regarding Moshiach, from the famous heartfelt plea “Do all you can to bring Moshiach!” 28th of Nissan 5751 (1991) to the fateful day of 27th of Adar 5752 (1992 when physically the Rebbe stopped communicating verbally.)
		This book was originally organized by Rabbi Maimon and approved by the Rebbe.
		"Moshiach is not what people think," as the Alter Rebbe said, “The Moshiach that is coming, is not what people think - and what people think is Moshiach, is not.”`

		Of-course, the Great and Holy Maagid founded - for all intents and purposes - the Chassidic movement, in that it was from his 60 Holy Disciples, Reb Nachum Chernobler, Zusha Of Anipoli… to the Alter Rebbe, that the Chassidic movement became what it is.

		description: `What is unique about this translation is that it is not a translation. The Tanya - the most important modern Jewish mystical / philosophical work has long been considered a very difficult read. My grandfather and father helped readers through “Lessons In Tanya,” however for the modern man who has very little time or patience I felt a new English Tanya was necessary. This is a paraphrased translation. In other words I took the ideas in the sequence they are presented in - in the Tanya - and I rewrote them into an idiom that modern man finds more compelling.`

		This book is a paraphrased translation of the book called “Baal Shem Tov on the Torah” written by Rabbi Shimon Menachem Mendel from the city of Gavarshov.
		What makes this collection special - for as he writes in his introduction - he collected from the many authentic sources, beginning with the primary redactors of the Torah of the Baal Shem Tov, Rabbi Yaacov Yosef Pulnah (Toildois Yaakov Yosef) and the Degel Machaneh Efraim among others (the Baal Shem Tov's Illustrious grandson) - is its exactness in finding the authentic teachings of the Baal Shem Tov.`

		description: `Rabbi Moshe Cordovera who lived in Tsfas (Safed 1522-1570) revolutionized Kabbalah by systemizing what otherwise could be perceived as perhaps a seemingly arbitrary collection of Kabbalistic teachings in the Holy Zohar (much like what the Shulchan Aruch (Code Of Jewish Law) did for the Gemarah/Talmud.)

Toward the end of his life he wrote a beautiful book in which he shows us - perhaps the most important calling of our time - how to let go of anger and resentment, and induce love, thereby not only realizing the great goal of humanity to act from unconditional love but furthermore as heaven is a reflection of earth hence like mist rises and creates clouds that become the rain (in an ongoing pattern…) so when we act from love we cause that our destiny from G-d should likewise create greater love and blessings.`

The Rebbe instructed (thanks Rabbi Micoel Selgison for this) the composition of Sefer Ha-erchin in 5723 (1963.)
